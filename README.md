# Weather-App

To use the app, type a name of the city and click on search/press Enter or else click on the Your location weather button, every time you click on the button first it will check if the data is available in the session storage or not, and if not then it will send a network request else it will take the data from session-storage.

Search weather details according to the city
Detect your current location for displaying weather data
Shows a map of that location
Sync data to get the latest updated details of the current weather
Toast notification for every action.

I have created this website using HTML,CSS, javascript.
